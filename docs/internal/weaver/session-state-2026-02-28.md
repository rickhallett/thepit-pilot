## HEAD and Branch State

- **HEAD (master):** `1c4da76` — permalink hotfix deployed to production
- **Gate:** green (1279 tests, 0 errors)
- **SD range this session:** SD-211 through SD-224

## Active Worktrees (CLEANUP OPERATION IN PROGRESS)

```
/home/mrkai/code/tspit           master              (main repo)
/home/mrkai/code/tspit-wt-a      cleanup/rename-the-pit      commit 3098692
/home/mrkai/code/tspit-wt-b      cleanup/dead-modules        committed (check git log)
/home/mrkai/code/tspit-wt-c      cleanup/test-tautologies    commit 86da49c
/home/mrkai/code/tspit-wt-d      cleanup/security-fixes      committed (check git log)
```

All worktrees have pnpm deps installed. Each branch has passed the local gate independently.

## Open PRs (MERGE SEQUENCE PENDING CAPTAIN'S ORDER)

| PR | Branch | Bugbot | Status |
|----|--------|--------|--------|
| #381 | cleanup/rename-the-pit | 1 finding → fixed, pushed for re-review | Awaiting merge |
| #382 | cleanup/dead-modules | 0 findings | Awaiting merge |
| #383 | cleanup/test-tautologies | 1 finding → fixed, pushed for re-review | Awaiting merge |
| #384 | cleanup/security-fixes | 0 findings | Awaiting merge |

**Merge order:** #381 → #382 → #383 → #384. Gate between each. No deploy without Captain's order.

## Layer Model v0.3 (TRIAGE HELD FOR NEXT TICK)

Captain ruled: annotations and additions ONLY, no structural mutations. Triage table with 17 items was presented. Model versioning workflow established (SD-220): current always at D2, previous versions archived. Named workflow: "model bump."

Captain also clarified: two-ship ≠ worktree subagents. Two-ship = horizontal scaling of prompt harness (SD-169). Worktree subagents = L6b dispatch + L7 isolation within one stack. Instance labelling needed in .keel-state (SD-221).

## Cross-Model Boot Data (SD-222)

Captain booted gpt-5.3-codex harness — it could not reconstruct HUD from boot sequence alone. Reported SD-149 as last known (actual: SD-219). Dead reckoning insufficient for cross-model cold boot. Needs investigation.

## Holding Deck

9 items. Priority: `zombie-code-audit` (active via PRs above). See `docs/internal/holding-deck.yaml`.

## Review Reports (locked 444)

## Site State

- **oceanheart.ai:** deployed, 291 pages, localhost bug fixed
- **decisions page:** live with 213 individual SD detail pages
- **Hugo build:** `make sync && hugo --gc` from `sites/oceanheart/`
- **Deploy (when ordered):** `vercel --prod --yes` from `sites/oceanheart/`

## What Was NOT Committed

- `sites/oceanheart/content/blog/2026-02-28-voice-analysis.md` has unstaged changes (from subagent, minor)
- Session decisions SD-220 through SD-224 are in `session-decisions.md` but not yet committed
- This file is not yet committed

## Parked

- Layer model v0.3 triage — held for next tick
- bout-engine.ts test coverage — identified as highest-value new test work
- Zombie code workstream E (drop dead DB tables) — depends on #382 merge
- On-chain SD attestation — holding deck, not urgent
- Compaction prompt logging — Captain undecided
