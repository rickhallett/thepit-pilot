## Entries

| Date | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | Context audit: 52 → 7 depth-1 files. O(1) triage table format enabled Captain to approve 7 decisions in one pass. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | Terminal HUD bridging agent and human via shared `.keel-state`. All 13 fields live. |
| 2026-02-27 | PATTERN | Captain responds fastest to numbered tables with a "my default" column. This is now called a Muster (SD-201). |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-195 `[context-audit]` 52 → 7 depth-1 files. Cleared the breakfast table. Valuable because it directly reduced the Captain's cognitive load on every session open — the research paper confirmed what he already knew independently. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-196 `[crew-prune]` Ghost crew, stale branches, lexicon rename, operational models elevated. Valuable because it removed phantom entries that had been silently consuming scan time — dead references are worse than no references. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-197 `[hud-terminal]` Python HUD + SD label convention. Valuable because it gave the Captain a persistent, glanceable external monitor — reducing the need to ask the agent "where are we?" and freeing ingress for O(1) decisions. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-198 `[hud-state]` .keel-state as shared bridge between agent and terminal. Valuable because it collapsed the gap between what the agent knows and what the Captain can see without asking — the shared file is the handshake. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-199 `[weaver-log]` Personal directory, learning log, boot-sequence diagram. Valuable because the Captain could see the full wiring diagram and confirm the system matched his mental model — the map and territory aligned. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-200 `[state-history]` Clone-before-write on .keel-state. Valuable because it turns ephemeral runtime state into an append-only audit trail — if the context window dies, the conditions at each gate run survive. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-201 `[slopodar-flag]` Provenance headers on v0.1 docs. Valuable because the meta-humour hit the sweet spot — an AI flagging its own output as untrustworthy is exactly the honesty signal that earns trust from veterans. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-202 `[muster-term]` "Muster" adopted for O(1) triage. Valuable because it gave a name to a pattern the Captain was already using, making it requestable — naming a pattern is what turns a habit into a tool. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | SD-203 `[commit-trailers]` Always-on git trailers. Valuable because deterministic beats selective — the Captain identified the reliability question before implementation and chose the option with zero failure modes. Record over aesthetics. |
| 2026-02-27 | SUCCESS | **Captain's commendation — "extra rations."** Captain issued `commit; push; bump; commit` — four commands that looked like a direct sequence. "Bump" had no payload (no pattern named). Weaver committed and pushed the first two, then held on the third and asked: "what pattern are we bumping?" Captain revealed it was a deliberate ambiguity test. The correct response was to stop and ask rather than fabricate a slopodar entry or interpret "bump" as a no-op. Ref: `7802f84` (the commit that was pushed before the hold). Principle validated: do not infer what you can verify. |
| 2026-03-01 | PATTERN | Broadside audits show that mock-heavy tests can hide boundary defects; negative tests + live-DB integration proofs are the fastest path to E3 evidence. |
