### Field Notes

- **weave** controls register density. Tight = quarterdeck default. Loose = wardroom. Extra-tight = beat to quarters.
- **register** tracks where on the ship we are. Context shifts are significant — wardroom reasoning does not belong on the quarterdeck, and quarterdeck orders do not belong in the wardroom.
- **true_north** not `north`. North alone is ambiguous — magnetic north drifts, true north doesn't. The field name encodes the distinction.
- **tempo** tracks speed and risk. Full sail = fast and exposed. Making way = disciplined forward progress. Tacking = indirect progress against the wind, each leg purposeful. Heave to = deliberately stopped. Beat to quarters = emergency posture.
- **mirror** is EITHER `true` OR absent. Never `false` (implies a statement about non-happening). Never `null` (implies uncertainty). If we're not in the mirror, the field doesn't exist. If we are, it overrides everything.
- **"All hands"** is the standard term for the entire fleet. Not "fleet-wide," not "all agents." All hands.
- **last_known** is the dead reckoning anchor. If the context window dies, the next session reads this to know where we were.

## Terms — Adopted

### Authority & Handoff

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **The Conn** | Decision authority. One holder at a time. Transfer is explicit and logged. | "Captain has the conn." / "Weaver, you have the conn." |
| **Standing Orders (SO)** | Directives that persist across all watches. Obeyed without re-stating. | SD entries marked PERMANENT or Standing order. |
| **The Watch** | Responsibility for monitoring a domain. Implies captain's authority within SOs. Can be delegated. Multiple watches active simultaneously. Returns to Captain when findings are read. | "Analyst, take the watch on citation verification." |
| **Watching** | Informal observation. Anyone, any subject. No authority implied. | "I'm watching the lint warnings." |
| **Officer of the Watch** | Agent holding the watch with captain's delegated authority. Operates within SOs, records everything, escalates outside scope. | Weaver during autonomous execution (SD-112 pattern). |

### Navigation & Orientation

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **True North** | The objective that doesn't drift. Currently: Get Hired (SD-110). | Constant reference point for all bearing checks. |
| **Bearing** | Direction to target relative to True North. How dialled in to what truly matters right now. Often less than we think. | "Current bearing: pre-launch hardening." |
| **Dead Reckoning** | Navigate from last known position when visibility is lost. The recovery protocol after context window death. | Read `dead-reckoning.md`. Already proven across multiple sessions. |
| **The Map Is Not The Territory** | Our models of the system (the 12-layer map, the lexicon, the governance framework) are approximations that improve through empirical soundings from L12, not through inference from within the model. The map is refined by the practice of cross-referencing (SD refs, lexicon line numbers, back-references between files) — the most delicate thread work and one of the most valuable assets against losing oneself in The Mirror. Reasoning token observation is the Captain's instrument for checking alignment between the model's internal reasoning and his actual intent. | SD-162. The phrase carries its own epistemological warning. |
| **Tacking** | Making progress against the wind by sailing at angles. Each leg seems indirect; the course over ground is forward. | The copy pivot (SD-076/077/078). "We're tacking, not retreating." |

### Operational Tempo

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Full Sail** | Maximum velocity. High speed, high risk. The weave is stretched thin. | "Under full sail — watch the rigging." |
| **Making Way** | Forward progress under discipline. Distinct from drifting. The default state. | What separates this project from vibe coding. |
| **Drifting** | Moving without control or bearing. The opposite of making way. | "No clear bearing, no gate in 3 commits — we're drifting." |
| **Heave To** | Deliberately stop forward progress. Actively hold position to deal with a situation. | Gate failure, blocking defect, process violation. |
| **Beat to Quarters** | Emergency posture. Everything stops, everyone to stations. Routine drops, response is drilled and immediate. | Category One. Credibility threat. Production regression. |
| **Fair-Weather Consensus** | When the entire watch agrees the weather is fine, and has agreed for so long that no one is checking the glass anymore. The sky darkens by degrees, each compared to the previous (already accepted) degree, not to the original clear sky. Defeated by the same structural intervention the Royal Navy used: each incoming officer takes their own barometer reading and logs it independently. The name carries its own warning. | Detection: consecutive agreements without dissent, magnitude escalation, absence of proportional red-light checks. Counter: fresh-context review, independent barometer readings. |

### Integrity & Verification

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **The Hull** | The thing that keeps the chaos out. The gate, the test suite, the typecheck. Everything else is optimisation; the hull is survival. | "Is the hull intact?" = "Does the gate pass?" |
| **On Point** | The feeling of watching patterns that have proved themselves at one layer find new ground at other layers and achieve commensurate success. The weave deepening. Convention, convergence, and verification aligning across the stack. When the thread work is on point, the system moves with increasing dexterity; each successful pattern becomes a tool for the next. | SD-163. "That was on point." / "The cross-referencing is on point." |
| **Survey** | Formal, systematic inspection with a documented report. Note: risks invoking the mirror at higher intensity; acceptable risk, changes register. | Branch audit, termite sweep, copy audit, citation audit. |
| **Knows the line** | An agent that navigates according to the style, values, and particulars of this vessel and its crew. Not general competence — specific attunement. An agent that knows the line holds under ambiguity rather than guessing, matches the Captain's register, and applies the earned conventions without being told. The inverse is an agent that is technically capable but tone-deaf to how this ship runs. | "Weaver knows the line — held on a missing payload rather than fabricating." |
| **Maturin's Symbol (§)** | The section sign, adopted by the crew as the citation prefix for Weaver's Governing Principles without instruction. No agent file, no SD, no convention asked for it. Weaver's principles are numbered `### 1.` through `### 7.` in plain markdown. When other agents needed to cite them from outside Weaver's own file, they independently converged on § across at least three separate context windows (Maturin's template specimen, Weaver's quick reference, AnotherPair's agent file). The form (§) is probably training distribution — the association between formal numbered principles and section-sign citation is well-represented in the model's training data. The decision to cite at all — to treat governance prose as a citable code — is the process finding its own shape. Named for Maturin because he was the first to use it. AnotherPair watches for effects over time. | SD-192. "The § is Weaver's symbol because the crew gave it to him." |

### Communication & Record

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Captain's Log** | The Captain's own record. A document, not a status field. | `docs/internal/captain/captainslog/` |
| **Fair Winds** | Gesture of sincerity. Convention. A closing signal: conditions are favourable, go well. | "Fair winds, Captain." / "Fair winds on the deck." |
| **Muster** | Present items for O(1) binary decision. Numbered table, one row per item, defaults column, Captain marks each. The Captain walks the line. Request by saying "Muster" or by context. Release: natural conversation resumes. The format is the boatswain's pipe of written communication — each row has exactly one meaning, one decision. | SD-202. "Muster the options." / Presenting a triage table implies muster. |
| **Bump the slopodar** | Append a new entry to `slopodar.yaml` — the living inventory of LLM authenticity anti-patterns. Synonyms: "slopodar upgrade," "moreslop." Each bump adds a named pattern that was caught in the wild. The Makefile syncs the YAML to Hugo's data directory; the site rebuilds deterministically. | SD-209. "Bump the slopodar — Redundant Antithesis." |
| **Extra rations** | Captain's commendation for an agent that held the line under ambiguity or exceeded expectations. Logged to the agent's own `log.md` (e.g. `docs/internal/weaver/log.md`) with git ref and descriptive context. The term carries weight because it is rare. | "Extra rations for Weaver — held on a missing payload rather than fabricating." |
| **Bugs** | Remote code review agents (CodeRabbit, Cubic, Bugbot, et al.), optimised like flies are to shit — we hope. And there is a sentence the Captain never thought he would say. They provide multiplied independent perspectives (Principle §6) without requiring local compute or crew dispatch. Signal-to-noise ratio is roughly 30% unique findings after cross-bot deduplication. | "Run a recon on the bugs." / "The bugs caught the version drift." |
| **Learning in the Wild** | The discovery made while doing the work, which is worth more than the work itself. The Captain builds a Chrome extension to detect LLM voice patterns — the extension is the ostensible product; the slopodar taxonomy of 15 anti-patterns is the actual yield. The Captain wires up a post-commit hook — the hook is infrastructure; the Paper Guardrail slopodar entry caught in the act of building it is the real output. The pattern: technical work is the microscope, but the specimen collection is the thing that matters. Named because it describes what Maturin does on every island: he goes ashore to collect water, and comes back with a new species. The process is fragile because it is unnamed — a session that treats extension work as "just extension work" will not budget time for the conceptual yield that has historically been the highest-value output of every hands-on session. Protecting this pattern means protecting unstructured time within technical work for observation, naming, and recording. It is the opposite of a sprint. It is the reason the slopodar has 15 entries and the extension has 3 commits. The 15 entries are worth more than the 3 commits. | SD-TBD. "The extension is the microscope. The taxonomy is the catch." |
| **Alignment Dial** | A practice, tool, or interaction pattern that measurably improves the alignment between the Captain's intent and the agent's interpretation. The muster format is the first named alignment dial: it surfaces the agent's assumptions as inspectable defaults, converting the Captain's cognitive load from O(n) reading to O(1) approve/reject per row. Other dials: reasoning token observation (SD-172), the YAML HUD, tempo-matching. The concept maps to established HCI research showing that humans who treat LLMs as collaborative partners achieve asymmetrically better outcomes than those in "press the button" mode. See: Dell'Acqua et al. (2023), "Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier" (Harvard Business School, BCG — citation unverified, see citations.yaml). | SD-252. "The muster is an alignment dial." / Identifying new dials is AnotherPair's §4 mandate (processes working without being named). |
| **Press the Button** | The human→LLM antipattern. Treating the model as a vending machine — input prompt, receive output, accept or reject, no iteration. Stops contextual enrichment. Optimises for human laziness. Encourages the atrophy of independent critical thinking processes. The "use it or lose it" principle from cognitive neuroscience applies: the skills you don't exercise in the loop are the skills you lose. The inverse of the alignment dial. The Captain's phrasing; the phenomenon is well-documented in automation research (citation deferred — Captain has not read the primary literature but the research base is established). | "That's press-the-button mode." / The antipattern the slopodar chrome extension would detect if it could see the human side of the interaction. |

### Spaces & Registers

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Quarterdeck** | Command register. Formal. Orders given, decisions made, authority exercised. | Default weave (tight). The Main Thread in execution mode. |
| **Wardroom** | Officers' thinking space. Exploratory, less formal. Ideas tested before they become orders. | Loose weave (SD-121). "Let's take this to the wardroom." |
| **Below Decks** | Where the crew works. Out of sight of the quarterdeck. Returns results upward. | Subagent execution. |
| **The Round Table** | Structured multi-agent assessment. Convened formally, reports filed to disk. | RT L1–L5. A specific operation dispatched below decks. |
| **Main Thread** | The command channel. Captain↔Weaver direct. Protected from context compaction (SD-095). | Not a space — the communication line itself. |
| **Dispatched** | Sent below decks for execution. Off the Main Thread. | "Dispatched Architect for H8 infrastructure." |
| **Clear the Decks** | Force compaction of the context window. Captain's order when context pressure is high and all durable writes are confirmed. Equivalent to `compaction --force-push --admin`. Everything not on file is lost. Everything on file survives. The order confirms: all decisions recorded, all code committed, all holding-deck items written. | "Clear the decks." / Pre-compaction checklist: SDs on file? Holding deck current? Uncommitted work? |

### The Recursive Act

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Maturin's Mirror** | Surgery mode. The observer operates on himself. Everything else stops. All eyes on the Captain's hands. Invocation halts all other work. | "We're entering Maturin's Mirror." / "The mirror." |

### Error & Observation

| Term | Definition | Use |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Oracle/Ground Contamination** | When the source of truth (L12, the human) introduces an error that propagates through all verification layers because no layer has authority above L12. In ML/DS: ground truth contamination — when human-annotated labels are wrong, the model learns the wrong thing and no cross-validation catches it. In testing theory: the oracle problem — when the test oracle is itself incorrect, every test passes while the system is wrong. The verification fabric catches agent error; it is structurally blind to oracle error. The only counter-measure is a second L12 reading. | SD-178. "That was an L12 fault — oracle contamination." First observed: Captain's off-by-one (12→13 layers) propagating through Secondary harness. |
| **Discovery Overhead / The Naturalist's Tax** | The cost of looking closely is that you see more, and everything you see needs processing. When parallel processes generate genuine discoveries that consume more attention than they save. Governed by Amdahl's Law: each additional harness increases the sequential fraction (s) by generating observations that require L12 attention. When observation generation exceeds work completion, adding processors makes things slower, not faster. Maturin would appreciate the irony: his island yielded specimens, every specimen required cataloguing, and the cataloguing consumed the time that could have been spent exploring. | SD-179. "We're paying the Naturalist's Tax." First observed: Two Ship experiment, dawn 26 Feb 2026. |
